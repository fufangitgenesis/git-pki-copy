### The Problem with "Busy"
Many of us fall into the "busy but not productive" trap. We finish a day full of tasks but feel no closer to our most important goals. It's hard to know where our time and energy truly go, making it difficult to improve.

The **Daily Effectiveness Logger** solves this by providing a private, data-driven mirror for your daily efforts. It moves beyond simple to-do lists to help you understand the *quality* and *impact* of your work.

### Core Features

* **üìà Quantitative Daily Score:** Log your activities against value-based categories (e.g., Deep Work, Shallow Work, Learning) to get an objective score for your day.
* **üìä Advanced Ratios:** Instantly see your **Focus Ratio**, **Distraction Ratio**, and **Productivity Throughput** to understand your effectiveness at a glance.
* **üéÆ Gamification Engine:** Stay motivated by earning XP, leveling up, and building daily logging streaks.
* **üóìÔ∏è Visual Analytics:** Use the **Weekly Timetable** and **Monthly Overview** to visualize your work patterns, identify your peak energy hours, and track trends over time.
* **üîí 100% Private & Offline:** All data is stored exclusively in your browser's **IndexedDB**. Nothing is ever sent to a server. The app works perfectly offline after the initial load.
* **üíº Data Portability:** You have full control. Export your entire data history to a JSON file for backup or import it to a new device.
